This displays a calendar in the browser.  It's accurate all the way back 
to January 1004 A.D.

IMPORTANT:  If you simply double-click the index.html file to open, it won't work
in every browser.  To work in every browser, index.html must be accessed as a server request.
For example, place the calendar folder in the server's document root.  Then go to this url in your browser:  localhost/calendar/index.html
